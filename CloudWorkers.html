      <h1>Game Design Document: Cloudworkers</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Game Title:</strong> Cloudworkers</p>
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Endless Scrolling, Action</p>
      <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Design Goal:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Cloudworkers is an endless scrolling game that focuses on increasing difficulty based on player progress. The
        goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score. Replayability is a key aspect of the game,
        allowing players to jump back in immediately after playing.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Core Concept:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>In Cloudworkers, players control a flying ship and navigate through the sky. The ship's fuel source is clouds,
        which the player must collect to keep the ship flying. The core mechanic revolves around flying and maintaining
        fuel levels to avoid obstacles and defeat enemies. The game offers strategic challenges as more enemies appear
        and obstacles approach faster.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>

      <br>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The objective of Cloudworkers is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score by collecting
        clouds, avoiding obstacles, and defeating enemies.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tapping or swiping left or right to change the ship's horizontal direction.</li>
        <li>The ship automatically moves forward, and the player's input adjusts its course.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Progression</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The game starts with the player controlling a ship with three lives and a fuel meter.</li>
        <li>The ship consumes fuel at a standard rate and additional fuel when moving.</li>
        <li>If the fuel meter depletes, one life is lost, and the fuel meter is partially refilled.</li>
        <li>The game continues until all lives are lost.</li>
        <li>The player's score is based on the distance traveled, clouds collected, and enemies defeated.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Clouds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clouds are the ship's fuel source.</li>
        <li>The player must collect clouds to maintain fuel levels.</li>
        <li>Clouds are scattered throughout the sky and must be actively collected by flying through them.</li>
        <li>Missing clouds will result in a fuel shortage and decrease the ship's lifespan.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Obstacles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Flying islands serve as obstacles in the sky.</li>
        <li>The ship automatically moves in the opposite direction of the obstacles.</li>
        <li>Colliding with an obstacle deducts one life.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Enemies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Kamikaze pirates are enemies that try to collide with the ship.</li>
        <li>The player can shoot rockets to destroy enemies.</li>
        <li>Rockets require fuel to be used effectively.</li>
        <li>If the fuel meter is too low, the player cannot fire rockets.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Score</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The player's score is calculated based on various factors, including distance traveled, clouds collected,
          and enemies defeated.</li>
        <li>A leaderboard tracks the highest scores achieved by players.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h2>Art and Audio</h2>

      <br>
      <h3>Visual Style</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The game features a colorful and vibrant art style.</li>
        <li>The sky is visually appealing, with moving clouds and unique floating islands.</li>
        <li>The ship and enemies have distinct designs to differentiate them from the environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Sound Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Upbeat and energetic music creates an engaging atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Sound effects accompany actions such as collecting clouds, firing rockets, and collisions.</li>
        <li>Audio cues provide feedback to the player, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Cloudworkers is an addictive endless scrolling game that challenges players to navigate the skies, collect
        clouds for fuel, avoid obstacles, and defeat enemies. The simple yet engaging controls, increasing difficulty,
        and replayability make it an enjoyable experience for players seeking an action-packed mobile game. With its
        vibrant visuals, immersive audio, Cloudworkers has the potential to captivate a wide
        audience of gamers that want to blow of some <s>steam</s> clouds.</p>
